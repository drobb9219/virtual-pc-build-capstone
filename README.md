# üñ•Ô∏è Virtual PC Build | Capstone Project

This is a hands-on capstone project completed as part of the [Diversity Cyber Council](https://diversitycybercouncil.com/) CompTIA Tech+ Career Readiness Program.

In this build, I used **Oracle VirtualBox** to design and configure a virtual PC, simulate hardware selection, install Ubuntu 20.04, and run a functional OS environment.

- Oracle VirtualBox
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (ISO)
- Guest Additions (for seamless VM experience)
- Visual Studio Code
- LibreOffice
- Scratch
- Python 3 (pre-installed + demoed)

## üß± Build Steps

1. Defined system purpose and performance goals (general use + dev tools)
2. Selected and configured virtual hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk)
3. Downloaded Ubuntu 20.04 ISO and installed it on a VirtualBox VM
4. Set up system tools (LibreOffice, Scratch, VS Code, Python 3)
5. Evaluated performance using System Monitor
6. Documented the full build process and created a video walkthrough
